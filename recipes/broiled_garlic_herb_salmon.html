    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Ok, I hate to give up this recipe because everyone loves it so much, and I do own and use it for my business and my clients love it. It is a broiled salmon, easy enough for a beginner and delicious if done right. This salmon goes great with red potatoes and some steamed veggies.
    <h3>Ingredients Needed For 2 Servings</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets</li>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon, halved, divided</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>6 lemon slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.    Advertisement    </li>
        <li>Pour oil into a medium bowl. Rinse salmon fillets and pat dry. Dip fillets into oil, being sure to coat both sides, and place skin-side down into the prepared baking pan. Squeeze as much juice as you can from 1 lemon half over the fillets. Coat both sides of salmon with parsley, oregano, basil, and garlic, and sprinkle with 1/2 of the kosher salt.      </li>
        <li>Place under the preheated broiler and cook until center is light pink and edges are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove fillets from the oven and immediately plate. Squeeze remaining lemon half over top and sprinkle with remaining kosher salt. Serve with lemon slices.</li>
    </ol>
